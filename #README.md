# README Tribute Page FreeCodeCamp
<!--draft-->
## Topic Selection: 
### Freddie Mercury
I struggled to come up with a  topic for my *FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page*, so I decided to initially start coding with placeholders.  
I chose **Freddie Mercury** simply because I happened to listen to a *'Another One Bites the Dust'* by **Queen** whilst working on my Tribute Page with placeholders.  
## Learning Journey: 
This is my very first coding project and I do not have any previous coding experiences.   
I started to learn about **HTML** and **CSS** on the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) website and worked through the Responsive Web Design Section.  
There was a lot of trial and error and many timed I had to look up, research and learn new things (some small, some big) for coding my Tribute Page.
